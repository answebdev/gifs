# GifTastic

# Project Description

GifTastic is a dynamic web page that populates with gifs using the GIPHY API. The user types in a topic of choice (e.g. "cat") and submits it. When the user clicks Submit, the page populates with the buttons of the search items submitted (e.g. "cat", "dog", "lamb", etc.). When the user clicks on the buttons that have populated the page, 10 still gifs will appear on the page dynamically, along with their respective rating. When the user clicks on the gif once, the gif becomes animated. When the user clicks once more on the animated gif, then the gif becomes still again.

This web page uses jQuery, AJAX calls, and Javascript, as well as HTML and CSS, including Bootstrap. The API used comes from https://giphy.com/. The fonts used ('Noto Sans', sans-serif and 'Noto Serif KR', sans-serif) come from Google Fonts. The favicon used on the tab is from Font Awesome.
